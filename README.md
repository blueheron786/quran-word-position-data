# What Is This?

The [quran.com-images](https://github.com/quran/quran.com-images) repo provides a pipeline to generate images for word-by-word Qur'an apps, as well as a companion database that gives you the positions (coordinates and sizes?) of each image on the page.

This repository simply provides a pre-run version of that, as a SQL database. Check the releases.
